                                        Hi, I am a Research Scientist at Montpellier University, France and worked with various 
                                        industries like Brain, Eclerx etc and universities in India and abroad Umea University, 
                                        Sweden, IIITA. I have involved part-time with UpGrad as a mentor. Here I am supervising 
                                        data science and machine learning MS students. I have given various talks and webinars in 
                                        India and Abroad. I am active in ML, DL and robotics since 2011.

                                        During my industry tenure I deployed various projects related to NLP, machine learning and 
                                        deep learning such as intent classification, recommendation system, negative news analysis etc. 
                                        I led the team of 6-10 people during her tenure into different projects. I received spot award

                                        I completed my Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India in Multimodel 
                                        Human Robot Interaction. The objective of my Ph.D. research is to create a framework for human 
                                        robot interaction using multimodal environment where speech and gesture have been extensively used 
                                        to accomplish this task. In this project a combination of Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures 
                                        and corresponding speech voices. I published 7 sci high impact factor journal papers and more 
                                        then 20 international conference papers. I received DST funding for presenting my paper in 35th 
                                        IEEE TENCON 2015 conference held in Macao, china. I received best paper award in IEEE 
                                        International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications, and Informatics (ICACCI) in 
                                        2014. I was the organizing member of various workshops, conferences. She is reviewer of IROS, 
                                        ICRA top renowned conferences of robotics. I also taught various subjects like soft computing, 
                                        human robot interaction, robotics and automation during my academic tenure. During my tenure 
                                        I supervised various bachelor and master students into their thesis. I am a active member of 
                                        various ML and robotics community.
