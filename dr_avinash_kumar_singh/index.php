                                        <p align="justify"><font size="4">
                                        Hi, I am Avinash, I am currently associated with <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr/">LIRMM lab Montpellier University France </a>as a post-doctoral researcher. 
                                        Here we are performing activity recognition for Human robot collaboration. I am a part of H2020 project SOPHIA.
                                        Before to the France, I was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in <a href="https://www.umu.se/en/">Department of Computing Science, Umea University Sweden </a>.
                                        We do work on training the robots in such a way that, if they will have any conflict with regard to performing any activity, they raise their concern and ask
                                         for the external help to resolve that conflict.  We are using Pepper robot as our testbed to test our algorithms. Prior to join this Post-Doctoral Program, 
                                         I was associated with <a href="https://www.hcltech.com/">HCL Technologies </a> as an Deputy Manager. There, I headed the Machine Learning team to design various solutions, such as an intelligent 
                                         KYC system, Information Mining, Signature Verification, Automatic Cheque Clarence. I had a chance to work with <a href="https://eclerx.com/">eClerx Services</a> located at Navi Mumbai as a 
                                         Technology Specialist for Machine Learning. I stayed there for almost one and half year and conducted various projects related to Email Classification, 
                                         Anaphora Resolution, Document Colouring.

                                        I am a Ph.D. in Human Robot Interaction from Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, <a href="https://www.iiita.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Information 
                                        Technology, Allahabad</a>. During my Ph.D., we aimed to build a reliable and intelligent framework for robots, so that they could 
                                        interact with human as we do in our daily life. We have developed a facial symmetry and component-based face recognition system 
                                        to mitigate the variable illumination and expression scenarios. Since we have used only a part of the face, the approach is 
                                        computationally faster. A research is also conducted to help police in criminal identification. We had NAO humanoid robot 
                                        which was trained to establish the verbal communication with human in the natural language (English). Nao communicates with 
                                        the eyewitness and tries to collect the visual as well physiological description about the criminal. This visual description 
                                        is then processed to find the match with the existing database, if the match is found, the information about the criminal is 
                                        retrieved otherwise Nao creates the sketch of the same.
